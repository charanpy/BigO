O(1) ->constant no loops

O(n)-> Linear for,while loops

O(n^2)->Quadratic -nested loops
O(n!)->Factorial-adding loop for every element

Iterating through half a collection i.e O(n/2) is still O(n)
Two seperate Collection O(a+b)
Two seperate collection when nested O(a*b)

Simplification of Big O 
*Remove constants
*Different terms for input
       1) + for steps in order
       2) * for nested steps
*Drop non Dominants
